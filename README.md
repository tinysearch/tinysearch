tinysearch is a lightweight, fast, full-text search engine. It is designed for
static websites.

tinysearch is written in Rust, and then compiled to WebAssembly to run in a
browser.\
It can be used together with static site generators such as
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/),
[Cobalt](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs), or
[Pelican](https://getpelican.com).

## Is it tiny?

The test index file of my blog with around 40 posts creates a WASM payload of
99kB (49kB gzipped, 40kB brotli).\
That is smaller than the demo image above; so yes.

## How it works

tinysearch is a Rust/WASM port of the Python code from the article
["Writing a full-text
search engine using Bloom filters"](https://www.stavros.io/posts/bloom-filter-search-engine/).
It can be seen as an alternative to [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) and
[elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), which are too heavy for smaller websites
and load a lot of JavaScript.

Under the hood it uses a [Xor Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08258) &mdash;
a datastructure for fast approximation of set membership that is smaller than
bloom and cuckoo filters. Each blog post gets converted into a filter that will
then be serialized to a binary blob using
[bincode](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode). Please note that the
underlying technologies are subject to change.

## Limitations

- Only finds entire words. As a consequence there are no search suggestions
  (yet). This is a necessary tradeoff for reducing memory usage. A trie
  datastructure was about 10x bigger than the xor filters. New research on
  compact datastructures for prefix searches might lift this limitation in the
  future.
- Since we bundle all search indices for all articles into one static binary, we
  recommend to only use it for small- to medium-size websites. Expect around 2
  kB uncompressed per article (~1 kb compressed).

## Installation

You can install tinysearch directly from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install tinysearch
```

To optimize the WebAssembly output, optionally install [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). On macOS you can install it with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install binaryen
```

Alternatively, you can download the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases) or use your OS package manager.

## Usage

A JSON file, which contains the content to index, is required as an input.
Please take a look at the [example file](fixtures/index.json).

ℹ️ The `body` field in the JSON document is optional and can be skipped to just
index post titles.

### Configuration

You can customize which fields are indexed and which are stored as metadata using a `tinysearch.toml` configuration file. Place this file in the same directory as your JSON index file.

```toml
[schema]
# Fields that will be indexed for full-text search
indexed_fields = ["title", "body", "description"]

# Fields that will be stored as metadata but not indexed
metadata_fields = ["author", "date", "category", "image_url"]

# Field that contains the URL for each document
url_field = "url"
```

If no configuration file is found, tinysearch will use the default schema (indexing `title` and `body` fields with `url` as the URL field).

Once you created the index, you can generate a WebAssembly search engine:

```sh
# Generate WASM files with demo for development
tinysearch -m wasm -p wasm_output fixtures/index.json

# Production-ready output (WASM only, no demo files)
tinysearch --release -m wasm -p wasm_output fixtures/index.json

# With optimization (requires wasm-opt from binaryen)
tinysearch --release -o -m wasm -p wasm_output fixtures/index.json
```

This creates a dependency-free WASM module using vanilla `cargo build` instead of `wasm-pack`.

## Demo

Try the interactive demo with a single command:

```sh
make demo
```

This will generate WASM files and start a local server. Open http://localhost:8000/demo/ to try it out.

You can also take a look at the code examples for different static site generators [here](https://github.com/mre/tinysearch/tree/master/examples).

### Configuration Examples

#### E-commerce Site with Product Metadata

For an e-commerce site where you want to search product titles and descriptions but also store metadata like prices and image URLs:

```toml
[schema]
indexed_fields = ["title", "description", "category", "tags"]
metadata_fields = ["price", "image_url", "brand", "availability"]
url_field = "product_url"
```

JSON structure:
```json
[
    {
        "title": "Wireless Headphones",
        "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "tags": "audio headphones wireless bluetooth",
        "product_url": "https://store.example.com/headphones-123",
        "price": "$199.99",
        "image_url": "https://store.example.com/images/headphones.jpg",
        "brand": "TechAudio",
        "availability": "In Stock"
    }
]
```

#### Blog with Author and Date Information

For a blog where you want to search titles and content but also store author and publication metadata:

```toml
[schema]
indexed_fields = ["title", "body", "excerpt"]
metadata_fields = ["author", "publish_date", "tags", "featured_image"]
url_field = "permalink"
```

#### Documentation Site

For a documentation site where you want extensive search across multiple content types:

```toml
[schema]
indexed_fields = ["title", "content", "section", "keywords"]
metadata_fields = ["version", "last_updated", "contributor"]
url_field = "doc_url"
```

## Library Usage (Experimental)

tinysearch can be used as a Rust library for programmatic search index generation and searching. This feature is experimental and the API may change.

Add tinysearch to your `Cargo.toml`:

```sh
cargo add tinysearch
```

Basic usage with the provided `BasicPost` struct:

```rust
use tinysearch::{BasicPost, TinySearch};
use std::collections::HashMap;

let posts = vec![
    BasicPost {
        title: "My Post".to_string(),
        url: "/my-post".to_string(),
        body: Some("Post content here".to_string()),
        meta: HashMap::new(),
    }
];

let search = TinySearch::new();
let index = search.build_index(&posts)?;
let results = search.search(&index, "content", 10);
```

For advanced usage including custom post types and configuration, see:
- [Basic library example](examples/library_basic/)
- [Advanced library example](examples/library_advanced/)

## Advanced Usage

For advanced usage options, run

```
tinysearch --help
```

Please check what's required to
[host WebAssembly in production](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/deploying-to-production.html)
-- you will need to explicitly set gzip mime types.

## Docker

If you don't have a full Rust setup available, you can also use our
nightly-built Docker images.

Here is how to quickly try tinysearch with Docker:

```sh
# Download a sample blog index from endler.dev
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinysearch/tinysearch/master/fixtures/index.json
# Create the WASM output
docker run -v $PWD:/app tinysearch/cli -m wasm -p /app/wasm_output /app/index.json
```

By default, the most recent stable Alpine Rust image is used. To get nightly,
run

```sh
docker build --build-arg RUST_IMAGE=rustlang/rust:nightly-alpine -t tinysearch/cli:nightly .
```

### Advanced Docker Build Args

- `WASM_REPO`: Overwrite the wasm-pack repository
- `WASM_BRANCH`: Overwrite the repository branch to use
- `TINY_REPO`: Overwrite repository of tinysearch
- `TINY_BRANCH`: Overwrite tinysearch branch

## Github action

To integrate tinysearch in continuous deployment pipelines, a
[github action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/tinysearch-action) is
available.

```yaml

  with:
    index: public/index.json
    output_dir: public/wasm
    output_types: |
